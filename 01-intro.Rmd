# Aspectos básicos

All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (`#`) per .Rmd file.

## Carga de datos

All chapter sections start with a second-level (`##`) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter.

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(Statamarkdown)
statapath <- "C:/Users/renzo/OneDrive/Escritorio/Stata16.exe"
knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path=list(stata=statapath), comment=NA)
```


```{stata}
sysuse auto, clear
summarize
```

### An unnumbered section {-}

Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a `{.unnumbered}` or the shorter `{-}` at the end of the heading, like in this section.
